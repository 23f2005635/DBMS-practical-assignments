# Data Collection and Data Insertion in College Database
 ### Objective: 
 To understand real-world data collection and data insertion in a
relational database using SQL.

## Instructions (Read Carefully)
1. Use the database schema created in Lab–2 (ER diagram and tables).
2. Do not use imaginary or random data.
3. All data must be collected from authentic sources, such as:
○ Official college website
○ Department webpages
○ Class timetable
○ Academic notices / prospectus
4. Data should correspond to B.P. Mandal College of Engineering, Madhepura, Bihar.

## Data Collection Guidelines

Students are required to observe and collect real values for the following:
### 1. Department
● Department ID (self-defined)
● Department Name (as per college records)
● Office Location / Block (if available); otherwise, put something like Block A, Block B...
etc.

📌 Source: College website / department page

### 2. Faculty
● Faculty ID (self-defined)
● Faculty Name (as mentioned on website/timetable)
